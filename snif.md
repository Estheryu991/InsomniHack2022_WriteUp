/**Snif
by Kevin

I lost the Windows password of somebody else machine and I'd like to access a bitcoin wallet some important data on it. The disk is encrypted with Bitlocker and I tried to retrieve the key by following a shady blogpost on the Internet but it keeps failing :( Maybe some kind of radiation that disturbs the process... Unless it's the soldering that could have been better?
