You were contracted by the Swiss company Palexxpo to conduct a forensic investigation following a recent targeted attack. According to their IT staff, the domain controller was compromised and some premises-related information stolen. Your goal is to identify who is behind the attack, what he/she plans to do with the stolen data and you might have to follow the trail into the wolf's den.
