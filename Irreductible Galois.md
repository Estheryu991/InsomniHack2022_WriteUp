Welcome in our Backward Secrecy Post Quantum Lightweight Schnorr Signature. We have provide a new modern Cryptographic Schnorr Signature algorithm with the following features:

* Backward secrecy: Encrypted messages in a session remain secure even
if the private key leaks.
* Post Quantum security: Unknown binary field representation prevents
quantum computation.
* Lightweight scheme: only 128-bit key size.
* Schnorr signature security.
