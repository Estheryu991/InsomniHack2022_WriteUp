/**Vaccine Distribution Center
by clZ

We though Covid19 was bad, but as it turns out, Covid22 is even worse! Some claim to already have a vaccine for this latest disease, but apparently they are not willing to give it to everyone. There are a few vaccination centers supposedly distributing the vaccine, maybe you can figure out how to get some?

- Center 1

- Center-2

- Center-3

Even though the vaccines are not freely available, we have been told how the distribution centers function: source

Note: the challenge is running on http.

If the public vaccination centers aren't working for you, we can potentially run a private one. Contact the author on discord for this.*/
