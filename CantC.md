Your friend loves mechanical keyboards, to the sadness of your ears. You recorded him practicing on Typeracer, before entering his admin password.

Typeracer:

train.mp3 train.raw text.txt

Password:

password.mp3 password.raw

Notes:

* US qwertz keyboard.

* The microphone and keyboard are positioned similar to a laptop with an integrated webcam.  

* Your friend's password uses 8 lowercase words from this list concatenated with a single space between each of the words.

* Flag format: INS{w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 w7 w8}, where wi are the 8 recovered words.

Hint: w2[0] = f*/
