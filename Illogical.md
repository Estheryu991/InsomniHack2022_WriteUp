Since the fall in grace of their major competitor, Currency Gmbh tries to take over the market with a new encrypted communications device. Unfortunately, because of the chip shortage they had to rely on very few components and roll their own crypto. But hey, at least they are not backdoored, right ?

That's what we think, so we typed the flag for you using their device, can you get it ?

FLAG FORMAT : ins-...

You'll find the following items in the challenge file :
 - hardware.bin - The FPGA bitstream
 - schematic.pdf - Hardware schematic
 - flag.mkv - Us typing the flag.

You can have a look at the device around the admins. Good luck !
